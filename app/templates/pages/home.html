    <h2 class="h2">Why DevSaver Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Developers today consume vast amounts of learning materials and tools.  
      Without a structured system, important resources are often lost among dozens of browser tabs or bookmarks.  
      DevSaver bridges that gap by turning the chaos into a searchable, organized resource base that grows with you.
