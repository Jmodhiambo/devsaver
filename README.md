# 🧠 DevSaver – A Developer’s Knowledge Hub API

> **DevSaver** is a full-featured backend project built to power a developer-oriented knowledge hub — a place where developers can **upload, manage, and share learning resources** such as videos, articles, and tools.
>
> The project started as a way to deepen my understanding of **backend architecture, testing, and modern Python development**, and has evolved into a clean, testable, and extensible API system.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**DevSaver** is not just a CRUD API — it’s a complete exploration of:

* Building scalable RESTful APIs using **FastAPI**
* Structuring projects with **SQLAlchemy ORM**
* Implementing robust **testing pipelines** with **pytest**
* Ensuring **data integrity and test isolation** using **factory_boy** and **Faker**
* Designing **reusable components** for future production-ready backends

The project also includes a **minimal frontend layer** for resource upload and visualization, enabling developers to interact with the API seamlessly.

---

## 🧩 Features

* **User Management** – Register, view, and manage user profiles
* **Resource Management** – Upload, categorize, and fetch coding resources
* **File Uploads** – Support for resource files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.pdf`)
* **Database Integration** – Persistent storage with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Factory-Based Test Data** – Deterministic and isolated testing using factory_boy
* **In-Memory SQLite for Tests** – Blazing-fast test runs without affecting production data
* **Modular Code Structure** – Clean, extensible, and production-ready layout
* **HTML Templates (Optional)** – Simple UI for uploads and dashboard visualization

## 🧪 Testing

DevSaver follows a **test-driven development (TDD)** mindset.
Tests are organized for **unit**, **integration**, and **functional** coverage with the following principles:

* Tests run in an **isolated environment** using an in-memory SQLite database
* Test data is generated dynamically using **factory_boy** and **Faker**
* CI-friendly structure for continuous integration setups (e.g., GitHub Actions)

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest -v
```

You’ll see detailed output showing model, route, and integration test coverage.
